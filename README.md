# Hash-Map
A hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to compute the index where the value is stored. This allows for fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion of values based on their keys.

In this exercise I created a hash map and added all the required methods for HM manipulation.
I also implemented a Linked List as it is an integral part of HM.

## Hash Map methods
| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| hash(key) | Generates hash code |
| set(key, value) | Assigns key & value to the hash key |
| printBucketData(index) | Prints value from a bucket |
| get(key) | Returns the value of provided key |
| has(key) | Looks for key in the hash map, returns true / false |
| remove(key) | Removes key from the hash map |
| length() | Returns num of keys inside the hash map |
| clear() | Removes all entries from the hash map |
| keys() | Returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map |
| values() | Returns an array containing all the values inside the hash map |
| entries() | Returns an array that contains each key / value pair |

## Linked List Methods
| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| insertNode(key, value) | Inserts new node into the linked list |
| printData() | Prints linked list data |
| checkDuplicate(key) | Looks for existing key inside the linked list |
| updateValue(key, newValue) | Updates the key with a new value |
